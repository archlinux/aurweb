    We normally deal with Redis by keeping its ConnectionPool globally
    referenced so we can persist connection state through different calls
    to redis_connection(), and since FakeRedis does not offer a ConnectionPool,
    we craft one up here to hang onto the same handle instance as long as the
    same instance is alive; this allows us to use a similar flow from the
    redis_connection() user's perspective.
