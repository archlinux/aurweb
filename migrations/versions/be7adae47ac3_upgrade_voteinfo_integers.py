upgrade voteinfo integers

Within `aurweb/schema.py`, these were previously forced to use
TINYINT(3, unsigned=True) types. When generating with dummy data,
it is very easy to bypass 3-character TU counts; in addition,
this is possible in the future on production, and so we should
deal with this case regardless.

All previous TINYINT(3, unsigned=True) typed columns are upgraded
INTEGER(unsigned=True) types, supporting up to 4-bytes of active TUs
and votes for one particular proposal.
