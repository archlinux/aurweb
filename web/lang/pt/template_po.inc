# INSTRUCTIONS TO TRANSLATORS

# This file contains the i18n translations for a subset of the
# Arch Linux User-community Repository (AUR).  This is a PHP
# script, and as such, you MUST pay great attention to the syntax.
# If your text contains any double-quotes ("), you MUST escape
# them with the backslash character (\).
