aurweb Translation
==================

This document describes how to create and maintain aurweb translations. It was
originally derived from https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/aurweb_Translation

Creating an aurweb translation requires a Transifex (http://www.transifex.com/)
account. You will need to register with a translation team on the aurweb
project page (http://www.transifex.com/projects/p/aurweb/).


Creating a New Translation
--------------------------

Before beginning, please sign up for an Transifex account and request the
addition of a new translation team for the aurweb project. Also, please do not
translate if you are unwilling to maintain or find someone to maintain the
translation. This is due to the fact that aurweb is a rapidly evolving project
and there are constantly new strings to be translated. If the translations get
too out of sync with the released versions, there will be too many untranslated
strings for the translation to be usable, and it may have to be disabled.

1. Check out the aurweb source using git:

$ git clone git://projects.archlinux.org/aurweb.git aurweb-git

2. Go into the "po/" directory in the aurweb source and run msginit(1) to
   create a initial translation file from our translation catalog:

$ cd aur-git
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ cd po
$ msginit -l <locale> -o <locale>.po -i aur.pot

3. Use some editor or a translation helper like poedit to add translations:

$ poedit <locale>.po

5. If you have a working aurweb setup, add a line for the new translation in
   "web/lib/config.inc.php.proto" and test if everything looks right.

6. Upload the newly created ".po" file to Transifex. If you don't like the web
   interface, you can also use transifex-client to do that (see below).


Updating an Existing Translation
--------------------------------

1. Download current translation files from Transifex. You can also do this
   using transifex-client which is available through the AUR:

$ tx pull -a

2. Update the existing translation file using an editor or a tool like poedit:

$ poedit po/<locale>.po

3. Push the updated translation file back to Transifex. Using transifex-client,
   this works as follows:

$ tx push -r aur.aurpot -t -l <locale>
