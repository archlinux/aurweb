aurweb RPC Interface
====================

Package Search
--------------

Package searches can be performed by issuing HTTP GET requests of the form
+/rpc?v=5&type=search&by=_field_&arg=_keywords_+ where _keywords_ is the
search argument and _field_ is one of the following values:

* `name` (search by package name only)
* `name-desc` (search by package name and description)
* `maintainer` (search by package maintainer)
* `depends` (search for packages that depend on _keywords_)
* `makedepends` (search for packages that makedepend on _keywords_)
* `optdepends` (search for packages that optdepend on _keywords_)
* `checkdepends` (search for packages that checkdepend on _keywords_)

The _by_ parameter can be skipped and defaults to `name-desc`.

If a maintainer search is performed and the search argument is left empty, a
list of orphan packages is returned.

Package Details
---------------

Package information can be obtained by issuing HTTP GET requests of the form
+/rpc?v=5&type=info&arg[]=_pkg1_&arg[]=_pkg2_&...+ where _pkg1_, _pkg2_, ...
are the names of packages to retrieve package details for.

Request Methods
---------------

Historically, the `type=multiinfo` `v=5` GET request has supported a
particular ordering of arguments. The POST request argument ordering
cannot be guaranteed, and so its behavior is different. Differences are
described below:

`GET`::
  `type=multiinfo` arguments are parsed by iterating the query string
  from last to first key, looking for an `arg` or `arg[]`. Once one is
  found, behavior diverges depending on which is found first: the `arg`
  parameter is used as the sole argument or the `arg[]` parameters are
  built into a list until a non-argument key is encountered.
`POST (experimental)`::
  All provided instances of `arg` and `arg[]` given to `type=multiinfo`
  are supported in unison:

  curl -d 'v=5' -d 'type=info' -d 'arg=one' -d 'arg[]=two' -d 'arg[]=three' ...

All other valid query types are supported without change.

Examples
--------

`search`::
  `/rpc?v=5&type=search&arg=foobar`
`search` by maintainer::
  `/rpc?v=5&type=search&by=maintainer&arg=john`
`search` packages that have _boost_ as `makedepends`::
  `/rpc?v=5&type=search&by=makedepends&arg=boost`
`search` with callback::
  `/rpc?v=5&type=search&arg=foobar&callback=jsonp1192244621103`
`info`::
  `/rpc?v=5&type=info&arg[]=foobar`
`info` with multiple packages::
  `/rpc?v=5&type=info&arg[]=foo&arg[]=bar`
