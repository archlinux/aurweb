Single Sign-On (SSO)
====================

This guide will walk you through setting up Keycloak for use with aurweb. For
extensive documentation, see <https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html>.

Installing Keycloak
-------------------

Keycloak is in the official Arch repositories:

    # pacman -S keycloak

The default port is 8080, which conflicts with aurweb’s default port. You need
to edit `/etc/keycloak/standalone.xml`, looking for this line:

    <socket-binding name="http" port="${jboss.http.port:8080}"/>

The default developer configuration assumes it is set to 8083. Alternatively,
you may customize [options] aur_location and [sso] openid_configuration in
`conf/config`.

You may then start `keycloak.service` through systemd.

See also ArchWiki <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keycloak>.

Configuring a realm
-------------------

Go to <http://127.0.0.1:8083/auth> and log in as administrator. Then, hover the
text right below the Keycloak logo at the top left, by default *Master*. Click
*Add realm* and name it *aurweb*.

Open the *Clients* tab, and create a new *openid-connect* client. Call it
*aurweb*, and set the root URL to <http://127.0.0.1:8080> (your aur_location).

Create a user from the *Users* tab and try logging in from
<http://127.0.0.1:8083/auth/realms/aurweb/account/>.
